### What does it do?
TourGuide is a relay script which will give advice on playing [Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com) within [KoLmafia](http://kolmafia.sourceforge.net). It details how to complete quests you're on, and what resources you have available.

It keeps track of your quests and resources and helps you complete ascensions as fast as possible.
